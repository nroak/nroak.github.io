After completing my PhD in Genetics at Baylor College of Medicine, I joined St. Jude Children's Research Hospital as a Bioinformatics Research Scientist.
The focus of my current work is to discover genetic basis of childhood cancer predisposition.
During my PhD, I developed [bioinformatic approaches (ADmiRE)](/admire/) to understand the impact of microRNA single nucleotide variation in human population and disease datasets.

## Research Interests

- Cancer predisposition in childhood and adult cancers.
- Understanding the role of non-coding RNA (microRNA) sequence variation in human population and diseases.
