## Professional Statement
_I have applied bioinformatic and functional biology approaches to identify causal DNA sequence variation in rare human diseases. Alongside, I have also undertaken many leadership positions and worked with local start-up companies that has helped me develop a transferable skill-set. My goal is to gain a role that allows me to further my genetics knowledge and team-work skills in the exciting genomics industry or academic settings._

### Research Interest
- Bioinformatic approaches to understand the link between genetic alterations and human diseases.
