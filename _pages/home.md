Bioinformatics Research Scientist at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. 


To know more about my scientific career, feel free to take a look at my [CV](/cv/) or list of [publications](/publications/).


In addition to doing science, I love to live-sketch scientific talks. You can find all of my picture summaries [here](sketchnotes).


I look forward to adding more content and maybe a few blogs to this website in coming days, so don't forget to check the site occasionally.
