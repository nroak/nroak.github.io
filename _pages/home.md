I'm a Genetics PhD student at Baylor College of Medicine pursuing the discovery of genetic alterations that impact human traits and diseases. More specifically, I have developed [bioinformatic approaches](https://github.com/nroak/ADmiRE) to understand impact of microRNA single nucleotide variation in human population and disease datasets.

## Research Interests

- Genetics of childhood cancers and rare diseases.
- Understanding the role of non-coding RNA (microRNA) sequence variation in human population and diseases.
- Bioinformatic approaches to understand the link between genetic alterations and human diseases.
