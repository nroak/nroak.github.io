### Overview

Over my Ph.D. years, I attended numerous scientific talks at the university and at national conferences, meetings.
In the process, I developed a note-taking habit using my tablet. I live-sketch the talk's scientific findings, figures/ graphs where possible.

### Important meetings include
- Biology of Genomes, 2018
- Molecular and Human Genetics Seminar Series, 2016-2018
- Annual Postdoctoral Career Symposium, Houston, TX
- Invited special lectures at Baylor College of Medicine, TX
